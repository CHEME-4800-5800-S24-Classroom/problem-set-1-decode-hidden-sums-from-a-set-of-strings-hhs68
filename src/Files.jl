    puzzleparse(filename::String) -> Dict{Int64, MyPuzzleRecordModel}

Complete the implementation of the puzzleparse method in the Files.jl file. 
The puzzleparse method takes a file path as input and returns a Dictionary with the following structure:
The key should be the line number (starting from index 1), 
and the value should be a MyPuzzleRecordModel instance holding the encoded line of text.
